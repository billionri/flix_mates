            New Faces® is under no obligation to provide exposure to competing sites through links or other methods in portfolio and may remove those at its discretion, and without notice. The New Faces® referral system is intended for work related offers and general inquires related to or leading to work or further discovery.

Managers, agents, and photographers who have been authorized to post on behalf of their clients may control Model and Actor portfolios in addition to their manager, agent or photographer portfolio.
            
            It is against New Faces® policy to allow competitor portfolio sites to solicit New Faces® members from an account at New Faces®. Any competing portfolio site or online agency site that signs up at newfaces.com for either a free member account or a paid upgraded account, and then actively solicits New Faces® members to join their competing website or online agency, could have their account deactivated at New Faces® discretion, and without refund.
            
            The Promotion and Recruitment of Escorts, Escort Services, Personal Companions, (etc.) are contrary to the purposes of New FacesT, and will not be tolerated in any fashion. Soliciting for, recruiting, or offering the services of escorts on this site is strictly prohibited. Portfolios that are used for the solicitation or promotion of escort services in ANY way will be immediately disabled with no refund. This includes (but is not limited to): Use of the referral system, hyperlinks to external sites promoting escorts, URLs (web addresses) promoting escorts and any other activity that the staff of New FacesT deems as solicitations, promotions, or offers.
            
            New Faces® has a stated policy regarding the posting of sexually explicit images to its web pages. Sexually explicit images are not permitted on this site. Sexually explicit images include but are not limited to images of sexual intercourse, obvious states of sexual arousal (erections), or overt sexual positions (such as noticeably visible or spread genitalia). Failure to adhere to this restriction will result in the removal of the images, and the disablement of that member portfolio. Consistent misclassification (rating) or categorization of images may result in the forced setting of ratings and in gross violations may result in the removal of your portfolio.
            
            New Faces® does not support bandwidth theft, the linking of images from New Faces® to other sites, or the misuse of links from Other sites to New FacesT. Anyone found linking images from New Faces® to other sites, copying content from New FacesT, or inappropriately linking to New Faces® (to increase their views - through use of hidden frames, or using programs to artificially raise page views, etc.) will result in permanent REMOVAL from New Faces® without notification and may necessitate the notification of the appropriate State and/or Federal authorities.
            
            You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, email address) on a bulletin board or in a chat room, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other parties, and shall therefore be the sole responsibility and liability of the poster.
            
            As a member of New Faces® - you will receive regular email updates and will be contacted by other system members seeking to work with you, and you will receive occasional email from the New Faces®. As new features or member programs and promotions are developed and launched you will be informed via the postings to the site and also by email. We endeavor to limit email contact as much as possible from the system administrators, however when email is sent and returned with an email bad address, we will attempt to locate a correct address from any linked web site, and failing that your portfolio will be disabled (if you discover your portfolio has been disabled because of bad contact information, please contact us with the correct information and we will re-activate your portfolio.)
            
            This User Agreement and any disputes arising out of or related to the Service and the Sites shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, International laws. By your usage of, or your posting to, this site constitutes your agreement to, but not limited to, the current conditions listed in this agreement.
            
            If you are 13 years or younger, you must have a parent, or a legal guardian enter and approve all information, and ensure that the parent or legal guardian's email address and contact information is used at all times. New Faces® reserves the right to change and modify these usage rules as appropriate and without notice.
            
            Violation of these Terms and Conditions will cause your membership to be terminated without a refund.
            
            "Paying to upgrade at NewFaces.com purchases an online portfolio and access to contact and be contacted by members. We do not sell casting details or breakdowns. Casting details and breakdowns are complimentary to our upgraded members."
